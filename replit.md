# Lexi CAO Meester - Multi-Tenant SaaS Platform

## Overview
Lexi CAO Meester is a premium multi-tenant SaaS platform serving as an "AI assistant for CAO questions, specialized in the greenhouse horticulture sector." The AI agent (Lexi) answers CAO questions based on 1,000+ documents (CAO's, labor law, secondment rules) using Google Vertex AI RAG with gemini-2.5-pro. The platform aims to provide significant cost savings (average â‚¬18,000/year) compared to traditional consultants. It offers a 3-tier premium pricing model (Starter, Professional, Enterprise) with monthly and annual subscription options, emphasizing compliance by providing general information, not legal advice.

## System Architecture
The platform features a multi-tenant hierarchy with SUPER ADMINs managing TENANTS (uitzendbureaus), who then manage TENANT ADMINs and END USERS (payroll employees).

**UI/UX Decisions:**
- **Color Scheme:** Navy blue (#1a2332) and gold (#d4af37) for a corporate look.
- **Design:** Modern, professional enterprise design with SVG icons replacing emojis. Dark mode supported with a toggle, featuring solid colors without gradients.
- **Responsiveness:** Fully responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop, including a collapsible sidebar and hamburger menu.

**Technical Implementations & Feature Specifications:**
- **Multi-tenant Isolation:** Achieved via subdomain routing (production) and session-based (development).
- **Chat Interface:** Interactive chat with Lexi animations, a chat history sidebar, and a search function (titles and message content).
- **File Management:** Users can upload PDF, DOCX, and text files for Lexi to analyze, with MarkItDown for PDF text extraction and OCR fallback. Files are stored in S3.
- **Artifact Generation:** Lexi can generate and allow downloads of documents like contracts and letters (PDF for all tiers, DOCX for Professional/Enterprise).
- **User & Subscription Management:** Features include adding/deleting/deactivating users, role changes, user limits, and Stripe integration for subscription management (direct paid model, no free trial).
- **Payment Security (Oct 2025):** Full Stripe Checkout integration with server-side webhook verification. Account creation happens ONLY after successful payment via `checkout.session.completed` webhook. Signup data stored server-side in `PendingSignup` table (password hashed) to prevent client-side exposure. Automatic cleanup of stale pending signups (24h). Supports card and iDEAL payments.
- **Compliance & Disclaimer Strategy:** Multi-layered disclaimers (checkboxes, first-chat warning modal, sticky chat disclaimer, AI response footers) to clarify that Lexi provides general information, not legal advice.
- **Legal Documentation:** Complete AVG-compliant Algemene Voorwaarden (470 lines, 16 articles) and Privacy & Cookiebeleid (431 lines, 14 sections) implemented at /algemene-voorwaarden and /privacy routes with professional HTML templates.
- **Support System:** An integrated support ticket system for customers to create, view, and respond to tickets, with admin management capabilities.
- **Dashboard Analytics:** Provides insights into total questions, active users, monthly usage, and top users.
- **Chat Storage:** All chat messages are stored in S3 (Hetzner Object Storage) as JSON files, with PostgreSQL storing only metadata for efficiency.
- **Frontend:** Built with HTML, Vanilla JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS v3 (PostCSS build for optimized performance).
- **Backend:** Flask (Python) handles all routes and business logic.

**System Design Choices:**
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for structured data.
